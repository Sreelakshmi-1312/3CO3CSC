        Wildlife photography is a genre of photography concerned with documenting various forms of wildlife in their natural habitat.
 As well as requiring photography skills, wildlife photographers may need field craft skills. For example, some animals and birds are difficult to approach and thus a knowledge
 of the animal's and birds behavior is needed in order to be
 able to predict its actions. Photographing some species may require stalking skills or the use of a hide/blind for concealment.
 While wildlife photographs can be taken using basic equipment, successfulphotography of some types of wildlife requires specialist equipment, such as macro lenses for insects, 
 long focal length lenses for birds and underwater cameras for marine life. However, 
 a great wildlife photograph can also be the result of being in the right place at the right time and often involves a good understanding of 
 animal behavior in order to anticipate interesting situations to capture in photography. 
 The world's three largest photography organisations, the Photographic Society of America, the Fédération Internationale de l'Art Photographique and the Royal Photographic Society have
 adopted a common definition for nature and wildlife photography to govern photography competitions, their respective presidents writing in a joint statement,
 "The development of a common definition for nature and wildlife photography will be an important step in helping photographers, many of whom enter competitions internationally,
 know what the rules are. It will also provide organisers with a very clear definition when they need to deal with the problem of ineligible images."
 The world's largest photography organizations, the Photographic Society of America, the Fédération Internationale de l'Art Photographique and the Royal Photographic
 Society have agreed on a definition for nature and wildlife photography that will be applied to photography competitions.The techniques of wildlife photography differ greatly from those used in landscape photography. For example, in wildlife
 photography wide apertures are used to achieve a fast shutter speed, freeze the subject's motion, and blur the backgrounds, while landscape photographers prefer small apertures.
 Wildlife is also usually shot with long telephoto lenses from a great distance; the use of such telephoto lenses frequently necessitates the use of a tripod
 (since the longer the lens, the harder it is to handhold). Many wildlife photographers use blinds or camouflage. <hr />
