      Nature photography is a wide range of photography taken outdoors and devoted to displaying natural elements such as landscapes, wildlife, plants, and close-ups of natural scenes and textures.
      Nature photography tends to put a stronger emphasis on the aesthetic value of the photo than other photography genres, such as photojournalism and documentary photography. 

"Nature photography" overlaps the fields of—and is sometimes considered an overarching category including --<b> "wildlife photography," "landscape photography," and "garden photography"</b>.

Nature photographs are published in scientific, travel and cultural magazines such as National Geographic Magazine, National Wildlife Magazine and Audubon Magazine or
      other more specific magazines such as Outdoor Photographer and Nature's Best Photography. Well known nature photographers include<i><a href="details.html"target="_blank"> Ansel Adams</a> </i>, <i>Eliot Porter,
      Frans Lanting, Galen Rowell, and Art Wolfe</i>.Nature photography helps to raise the profile of our planet and the environment. It allows people to experience things they may not see themselves,
      and therefore encourage
      s them to care about its preservation. You can, in a small way, help to raise awareness of the natural world and work to promote its conservation. 
      A nature photographer often works for many years to develop their powerful skill set, portfolio and reputation to help them develop their career and sell their images as a freelancer or find a full-time position with a publication.
      The<i><a href="macro.html"target="_blank">Macro photography</i></a> article explains close-up photography in general; however, this is also a type of nature photography. While common macro subjects – bees, dragonflies, and so on – could be described as wildlife, their world also makes for good photography.

Many photographers record images of the texture in a stone, tree bark, leaf, or any of other small scenes. Many of these images are abstract. Tiny plants and mushrooms are also popular subjects. Close-up nature photography
      doesn't always need a true macro lens; however, the scenes here are small enough that they're generally considered different from regular landscapes. 
      Color images are not a requirement of nature photography. Ansel Adams is famous for his black-and-white depictions of nature, while Galen Rowell praised Fujifilm Velvia film for its bright, saturated colors, asking "Who wants to take dull pictures
      that will last a hundred years?" Both men distinguish between photography as an expressive art form and sensitometry; an accurate reproduction is not necessary. 
      A number of ethical concerns and debates surround the creation of nature photography. Common issues involve the potential of stress or harm to wildlife, the potential of photographers overrunning and destroying natural areas, the use of game farms, and veracity and manipulation in photography. 
      Also the information posted by photographers on social media of the location of endangered species leads to poachers using this information to hunt these animals.
