      Landscape photography is the art of capturing pictures of nature and the outdoors in a way that brings your viewer into the scene. 
  From grand landscapes to intimate details, the best photos demonstrate the photographer’s own connection to nature and capture the essence
  of the world around them. Below, you’ll find all the landscape photography articles we have written over the past decade, including our highly 
  approachable tutorials and techniques.   If you want to learn everything there is to know about taking beautiful landscape pictures, this is the place to start.
  Landscape photography shows the spaces within the world, sometimes vast and unending, but other times microscopic. Landscape photographs typically capture the presence 
  of nature but can also focus on man-made features or disturbances of landscapes. Landscape photography is done for a variety of reasons. Perhaps the most common is to
  recall a personal observation or experience while in the outdoors, especially when traveling.
  Others pursue it particularly as an outdoor lifestyle, to be involved with nature and the elements, some as an escape from the artificial world.Many landscape 
  photographs show little or no human activity and are created in the pursuit of a pure, 
  unsullied depiction of nature, devoid of human influence—instead featuring subjects such as strongly defined landforms, weather, and ambient light.As with
  most forms of art, the definition of a landscape photograph is broad and may include rural or urban settings, industrial areas or nature photography.Landscape 
  photography commonly involves daylight photography of natural features of land, sky and waters,
  at a distance—though some landscapes may involve subjects in a scenic setting nearby, even close-up, and sometimes at night.

Photography of artificial scenery, such as farm fields, orchards, gardens and architecture, may be considered "landscape" photography as well. 
  Even the presence of man-made structures (buildings, roads and bridges, etc.) or art (such as sculpture) may be considered "landscape" if
  presented in artistic settings or appearing (or photographed) in artistic style.

Further, landscape photography is typically of relatively stationary subjects—arguably a form of "still life." This tends 
  to simplify the task, as opposed to photography of kinetic or live subjects. However, landscape photography often overlaps the 
  activity of wildlife photography and the two terms are used somewhat interchangeably; both wildlife and landscapes may be elements of the same picture or body of work.
